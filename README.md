# Real-Time Fish Catch Prediction Website

This is a web-based project designed to help anglers predict the best times and locations to catch fish using real-time data such as weather conditions, tide levels, and solunar activity.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The main goal of this web application is to offer a platform for:
- Viewing predicted fish activity based on external APIs.
- Exploring fishing spots on an interactive map.
- Viewing tide and solunar forecasts.
- (Optional) Sharing fishing spots and photos (social features).

## 💡 Key Features

- 🌍 **Interactive Fishing Map** — Display of fishing locations.
- 🧭 **Real-Time Forecast Tools** — Tide, Solunar, and Weather prediction.
- 🐟 **Fish Activity Estimator** — Helps identify the best times to fish.
